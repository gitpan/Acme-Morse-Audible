Acme::Morse::Audible version 1.00
=================================
NAME
    Acme::Morse::Audible - Audio(Morse) Programming with Perl

SYNOPSIS
            use Acme::Morse::Audible;
            print <<Message;
            "For there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, `What has God wrought!'"
        
                    --Bible, Numbers 23:23
                
            (The first telegraphic message. Dispatched by Samuel F. B. Morse on May 24, 1844 from Washington D.C. to Baltimore.)
            Message

DESCRIPTION
    The first time a program is run under "use Acme::Morse::Audible;", it
    will become a playable MIDI file with the Morse encoding of the code.
    (Dots and dashes encdoding, actually. Morse Code contains only
    alphabet.) The program will continue to run as it did before, but will
    now also be audible. (Some players might not play it unless you rename
    it to .mid.)

  DIAGNOSTICS

    "Cannot record '%s'."
                Acme::Morse::Audible could not access the source file to modify it.

    "Cannot hear '%s'."
                Acme::Morse::Audible could not access the source file to execute it or read it for first-time encoding.
