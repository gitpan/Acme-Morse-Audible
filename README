Acme::Morse::Audible version 1.10
=================================
NAME
    Acme::Morse::Audible - Audio(Morse) Programming with Perl

SYNOPSIS
            use Acme::Morse::Audible;
            print <<Message;
            "For there is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel; now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, `What has God wrought!'"
        
                    --Bible, Numbers 23:23
                
            (The first telegraphic message. Dispatched by Samuel F. B. Morse on May 24, 1844 from Washington D.C. to Baltimore.)
            Message

DESCRIPTION
    The first time a program is run under "use Acme::Morse::Audible;", it
    will become a playable MIDI file with the Morse encoding of the code.
    (Dots and dashes encoding, actually. Morse Code contains only alphabet.)
    The program will continue to run as it did before, but will now also be
    audible. (Some players might not play it unless you rename it to .mid.)

  STATUS QUO ANTE BELLUM

            no Acme::Morse::Audible;

    Running the audible program with "no Acme::Morse::Audible;" instead of
    "use Acme::Morse::Audible;" will make it readable back again (and no
    longer audible). The "no Acme::Morse::Audible;" has no affect on a
    readable program.

  DIAGNOSTICS

    "Cannot record '%s'."
        Acme::Morse::Audible could not access the source file to modify it
        (substitute readability with audibility or vice versa).

    "Cannot hear '%s'."
        Acme::Morse::Audible could not access the source file to read it.
